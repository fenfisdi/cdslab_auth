# ===================
# QR_PATH -> location where the QR code is located
#
# FILL_COLOR -> color used to generate the QR, black
#   is conventional, but other colors can be used
#   without generating problems
#
# BACK_COLOR -> color used as the background when
#   generating the QR code
#
# COLOR_COMPOSITION -> type of color scheme used in
#   the generation of the QR, others HSL or HSV can
#   also be used, but we recommend RGB.
#
# QR_TYPE -> image format used to generate the QR
#   code, the library supports other filetypes,
#   but it is a convention to use *.jpg or *.png.
